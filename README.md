# lidar-rs
A project that's designed to replicate a spooky LIDAR exploration look and feel.

## Running
To run this program, you can use `cargo run`, however you might need a patched
version of `bevy`.

Additionally, you need to place a scene in `assets/models/scene.glb`. I have
tried a custom scene and the bistro scene with good results.
